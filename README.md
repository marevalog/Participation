# Participation
Codes for matched randomization and random sampling

All codes pushed into this repository should follow the standards of this style guide http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml
and no datasets with sensitive information should be saved in this repository.

This repository contains codes used to:
- create clusters based on specific numbers of houses in city blocks
- calculate aggregated measures at the cluster level (infestation and participation)
- match the clusters based on infestation and participation

It also contains the code for taking a random sample of houses in each cluster, with extra sampled houses in the first clusters. The extra sampled houses might be discarded and will be used for piloting surveys and training personnel.
